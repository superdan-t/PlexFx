# PlexFx
PlexFx is a lighting effect library intended for Arduino, but generic enough to support other platforms.
## Inactivity Notice
I have not updated or otherwise maintained this project since late 2020. This project may be incomplete or buggy, but I believe I used it in at least one project since development. There's at least some chance I will use code or concepts from here again, but there are probably better libraries out there.
